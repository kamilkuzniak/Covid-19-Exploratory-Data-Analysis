Covid-19 Exploratory data analysis
-------------------
* Exploratory data analysis based on the daily reports and the time series data
provided by the Johns Hopkins University.
* Firstly, the daily reports and time series for the whole world were analyzed
the total sums of all cases worldwide have been calculated and the graphs of 
confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries over time for the whole world have been plotted
* It was observed that the pandemic appears to be gaining momentum, the exponential growth
of the number of cases is getting faster
* Mortality over time has been plotted, it was observed that after peaking in may, the case fatality
ratio has dropped significantly
* Growth factor of the pandemic worldwide seems to have stabilized around the value 1, 
to end the pandemic effort will have to be made to lower it below 1
* Top 10 countries with the most confirmed cases have been looked into more in-depth
with line plots and area plots
* Choropleth maps of the mortality rate around the world, the number of cases in Europe and in the United 
States have also been prepared to give additional insight into the geography of the pandemic
